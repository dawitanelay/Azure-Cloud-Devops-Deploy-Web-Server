# Azure Infrastructure Operations Project: Deploying a scalable IaaS web server in Azure
![alt text](diagram/Architectur-Diagram.png)
### Introduction
Infrastructure as code is one of the five practices that we consider the heart of DevOps. Infrastructure as code provides a significant 
benefit in terms of creating, deploying, upgrading, and deleting infrastructure. Infrastructure as code make the deployment procedure as simple 
as pressing a button.

[Packer]( https://www.packer.io/docs_) a server templating software written in JSON, will be used to create virtual machine images containing our application for repeatable deployments.
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a provisioning tool that creates infrastructure according to a configuration file that you create. 
This file can be saved and reused which enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure.

For this project, you will write a Packer template and a Terraform template to deploy a customizable, scalable web server in Azure.
